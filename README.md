## 1. Excel skills:
### Description
Proficient in utilizing Pivot Tables for data analysis, enabling effective data summarization and visualization. Skilled in Data Validation to ensure data accuracy and consistency, with strong expertise in VLOOKUP for efficient data retrieval from large tables. Adept in using simple functions like SUM, AVERAGE, COUNTIF, CONCAT and others for basic data calculations. Experienced in cleaning and transforming datasets to maintain data integrity for analysis.

## 2. Microsoft Power BI Skills:
### Description
During my time at Turing College, I developed multiple Power BI dashboards, gaining hands-on experience in various aspects of data visualization and business intelligence. I learned how to efficiently transform and model data, create interactive reports, and utilize advanced features such as DAX formulas for custom calculations. I also became proficient in connecting different data sources, building relationships between datasets, and designing user-friendly dashboards that effectively communicate insights. These skills have equipped me to confidently apply Power BI in a professional setting, adding real value to any data-driven decision-making process. You can view highlights of my work in the table of contents, here you can see pbix version of the dashboards: [My first Power BI dashboard](My%20first%20powerbi%20dashboard.pbix); [Financial dashboard in Power BI](Financial%20overview%20dashboard.pbix); [Customer segmentation in Power BI](Customer%20segmentation%20POWER%20BI.pbix)

## 3. Cohort analysis:
This is a basic cohort analysis where I applied conditional formatting to visually highlight customer retention and churn trends.

## 4. Funnels analysis:
This analysis focused on the customer journey across five key countries (United States, India, Canada, United Kingdom, France), tracking progression from session start to purchase. Funnel visuals were incorporated to enhance the interpretation of the results.


## 5. Customer lifetime value:
In my recent project, I conducted a Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis by grouping customers into cohorts based on their initial purchase date. I calculated the revenue generated per customer for each cohort over time, allowing us to identify patterns in how customer value evolves. Once I gathered these revenue metrics, I analyzed trends such as seasonality to determine if external factors, like specific time periods or seasonal shifts, impacted customer spending behaviour. This analysis helped us gain deeper insights into customer retention and purchasing habits. Unfortunately, the analysis showed that we were actually losing money per customer, as the revenue generated was lower than the cost of acquisition.


## 6. AB testing:
The main goal of this project was to evaluate which of three marketing strategies (Promotions 1, 2, and 3) was the most effective in driving sales. An A/B test was conducted and the results were analyzed using key statistical tools, including ANOVA and t-tests, with a confidence level of 99%. The dataset included key metrics such as market size, store age, and sales in thousands, which helped assess the impact of each promotion on overall business performance.
Based on the statistical analysis, Promotion 1 was identified as the most effective, generating the highest average sales and showing a significant difference compared to Promotion 2. While Promotion 3 performed similarly to Promotion 1, no significant difference was found between them. However, Promotion 2 underperformed in both total and average sales. Therefore, I recommend prioritizing Promotion 1 in future campaigns, with Promotion 3 as a secondary option. Promotion 2 should be deprioritized due to its lower overall impact on sales.
