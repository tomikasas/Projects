### Description
During my time at Turing College, I developed multiple Power BI dashboards, gaining hands-on experience in various aspects of data visualization and business intelligence. I learned how to efficiently transform and model data, create interactive reports, and utilize advanced features such as DAX formulas for custom calculations. I also became proficient in connecting to different data sources, building relationships between datasets, and designing user-friendly dashboards that effectively communicate insights. These skills have equipped me to confidently apply Power BI in a professional setting, adding real value to any data-driven decision-making process.
